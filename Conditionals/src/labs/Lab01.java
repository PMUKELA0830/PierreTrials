		/* Note# The assumption is, you have completed the pre-course work and 
		 * have basic knowledge about methods, loops, variable and condition statements.
		 * 
		 * 1. Write a method called "max3" that finds the largest of THREE integers.
		 * 2. Write a method called "min3" that finds the smallest of THREE Integers.
		 * 3. Write a method called "middle3" that computes the MIDDLE value of THREE integers. 
		 * Hint: for the case of three numbers, the middle is the value that is NOT the maximum 
		 * NOR the minimum, so add the three values and subtract out the min and max, 
		 * using the methods you wrote for problems #1 and #2.
		 * 4. Write a method called "xor" that takes two boolean values (either true or false) 
		 * and returns a boolean value which is true if EITHER of the values is true 
		 * BUT NOT BOTH of them. This is called the "xor" function, or "eXclusive OR" 
		 * (where we are excluding the case where both values are true).
		 * 5. Write a method "isFactor" which takes two integers (k and n) 
		 * and returns true if ("if and only if") k is a factor of n.
		 * 6. Write a method "isPerfect" which takes an integer and returns true if 
		 * that integer is a perfect number Your method MUST call the "isFactor" 
		 * method you wrote for problem #5.
		 * 7. Write a method "isPrime" which takes an integer and returns true if it is 
		 * a prime number. Your method MUST call the "isFactor" method you wrote for problem #5.
